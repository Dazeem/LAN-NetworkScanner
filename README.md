# LAN-NetworkScanner
This is a simple Python-based LAN network scanner that detects and lists all devices connected to your local network. It uses ARP requests to find each deviceâ€™s IP address, MAC address, and hostname. The script is lightweight, requires only the scapy library, and is easy to run on any system with Python installed.
